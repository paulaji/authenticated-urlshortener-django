# Django and React Web Application

This project combines Django as the backend framework and React as the frontend library to create a web application with user authentication, note management, and URL shortening features.

## Backend Setup (Django)

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   venv\scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install Django:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

3. Create a Django project and an app:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject backend
   python manage.py startapp application
   ```

4. Install Django REST framework and SimpleJWT:

   ```bash
   python -m pip install djangorestframework djangorestframework-simplejwt
   ```

5. Configure CORS in `settings.py`:

   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       # ...
       'corsheaders',
       'rest_framework',
       'rest_framework_simplejwt',
       # ...
   ]

   MIDDLEWARE = [
       # ...
       'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware',
       # ...
   ]

   CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True
   ```

6. Create models, serializers, views, and URLs for your application, and migrate:

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Frontend Setup (React)

1. Create a React app:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app frontend
   ```

2. Install React Router and JWT decode:

   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom jwt-decode
   ```

3. Set up the React components, context, and pages as described in your project structure.

4. Create private routes for authenticated access using `AuthContext` and `jwt-decode` to handle token decoding.

5. Set up API calls to interact with the Django backend using the provided endpoints.

6. Install Bootstrap for styling and visual aesthetics:

   ```bash
   npm install bootstrap
   ```

7. Use absolute backend URLs to access different services, as described in your frontend setup.

8. Run the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
